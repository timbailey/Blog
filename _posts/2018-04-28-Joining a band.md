For those of us with a more than a few summers behind us, making music - playing an instrument - has more than likely become a solitary vice. 

In younger days, there were other like minded chaps (and sadly they were all chaps) indeed we hung . However, as the years have passed life got in the way. And that's OK for some people, why should we feel the same when we are twice tha age (at least) of the person who got a rush from playing Hey Jude on a twelve string with their mates. The intoxicating realisation that four mediocre instrumentalists can make a collective noise with... with... something of merit. Just occasionally, through accident of circumstance, the memory surfaces. Then what do you do?

The dusty guitar is still there, getting picked up occasionally. The motivation to play has changed, more likely a stress relever, than a magic key to infamy and (one hoped) casual intimacy. No longer do you see yourself astride the stage of the 100 Club, it is now more pedestrian distraction that is not your phone. 

The biggest change is likely that whatever musical practice remains, it is solitary. Learning covers, or taking advantage of the vast processing power and sophistication of the portable Abbey Road on your laptop. 

There is some magic 

Why play with others. 


So what options do you have trying to find others to play with. 

A community choir is a solid option for many. Singing in a group will increase your confidence and the practice pay off in your voice. It certainly provides the serotonin hit of 'creating with others'. 

Taking lessons offers a way of breaking out of a rut.  Committing to tutor led development provides a confidence boost and can move you into new area's of practise, or even styles of music. When MO did this, the outcome was to give this guitarist a new love of playing bass and the founding of Oil City PickUps. Neither of which were expected.

These are the gateway drug for the good stuff - playing in a band.
