Out of the dust and heat of Los Angeles come LA Witch, who after three solid years of touring have  released their imaginatively titled 'LA Witch' debut album. The hard miles on the road pay off in set of taught, well arranged sonds that offer coherence of intent over diversity of sound. That sound is  an amalgam of surf-noir, twangy reverb drenched guitar, louche laid back drums and a deep resonant, anchored, bass. The group reaches way back for their influences - Duane Eddy, 60s female groups and the odd Sergio Leone movie, while creating an edgy, anxious and very 'now' sound, pulsing in the dry, dry heat of a heavy desert vibe.

This is not stylistically varied music, but the same could be argued for the Stooges. Like Detroit's finest, the appeal of LA Witch is the intensity and commitment they bring. Self producing was a practical move, even if the production seems a little nieve at times (the opening bass is just too penetrating to my mind), it has allowed the band to capture their essense. Others report LAW at their very best live - which is no surprise given the gestation of their debut.
