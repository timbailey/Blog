South by South West (ubiquitously SxSW) is a festival like no other. Held in Austin Texas, a liberal enclave within a sea of Trumpland America, the festival is an eclectic mix of cutting edge interactive technology, film, music and general cultural expression. Now in its 31st year, the official music strand is a prestigious opportunity for bands to get infront of people of many different musical tastes, network and add 'Appeared at SxSW' to their CV.

The festical employs a stratified level of venue access with 'badge wearers' - who pay up to $1,500 for access,  as the alphas. Most mere mortals (and performers) sit within the second tier 'wristband' beta tribe. They watch enviously as badge holders get expedited access to the most popular gigs. The 'ordinary punter' is lucky to find official events they can get into, even paying the ubiquitous $10 cover charge. 

This levle exclusivity for the official festical spawns an eco system of venues taking advantage of the demand for a fringe. Many smaller events, such as ['South by San Jose'](https://www.sanjosehotel.com/hotel-events/south-x-san-jose/) - a stage set up in the yard of the hotel San Jose on South Congress, prosper and host bands that also play on the official programme. These are, in some senses, better - SxSJ had the atmosphere of a neighbourhood festival with people greeting each other like long lost friends every two yards. A throughly excellent and free alternative, but one that exists because of the main programme and its deep pocketed badge holders.

And the bands, so many bands. It is claimed that there were 2,000 different bands playing during the music week of SxSW this year. Wandering around the city, this felt intuitively right. From late morning, to early the following morning, it was difficult to find a bar, venue, pub, green space, store front, roof top or parking lot that did not have some form of live music in session. After a few days it felt like sensory overload. Walking around the more interesting parts of the city, such as South Congress, was an excellent sonic palette cleanser that allowed one to return to the fray with fresh ears.

The number of opportunities to hear live music, like a child in a sweet shop, ends up decision paralysis when trying to put together an itinerary. Going with others allowed random chance and serendipity to play a part - more knowledgeable friends are also useful. Chasing the big names, or the hyped new bands provided plenty of opportunities to see the SxSW class system in action and wonder whether that $1,500 was not such a bad idea after all.   

Music Obscura (MO for the uninitiated) attended this year as road manager/go-for for [The President Lincoln](https://www.thepresidentlincoln.com/), a transatlantic sextet of an indie americana tendency and (for full disclosure) personal friends. The Prez who are signed to the Austin label [Nine Miles Records](http://www.ninemilerecords.com/) were on the official SxSW bill. Attending in this way provided a number of advantages, not least of which was, as crew I was able to purchase an $80 pass that welcomed me to the 'wristband wearing betas'. Helping a band perform four gigs in four days also provided a perspective from 'behind the curtain' experiencing what the bands see of the event.  Without having a 'job' MO suspects SxSW becomes an exercise in endurance, seeing if one can keep the drink to gig ratio to the right side of unity for the week. Which side, dear reader, I leave for you to judge.

### The obligatory 'Hot Trends' list.
Wholly prejudiced and partial observations on the SxSW band scene.

#### ONE: Fender Jazzmasters EVERYWHERE.
 
It was not obvious that the Jazzmaster had historically been one of Fenders also ran models in terms of sales and influence. Yes, [(Sonic Youth)](http://www2.fender.com/experience/fender-tone/introducing-the-sonic-youth-signature-jazzmaster-guitars/), yes [Elvis Costello](https://www.musicradar.com/reviews/guitars/fender-elvis-costello-jazzmaster-174903), but after that... AT SxSQ they were ubiquitous to the point that MO and friends inventing a Jazzmaster drinking game. Personally, MO finds the shallow, wide neck profile difficult to get used to, but this seems a minority opinion.

#### TWO: Guitar Reverb, particularly the EHX Cathedral pedal EVERYWHERE. 

Where a Jazzmaster went, an EHX Cathedral reverb pedal followed. Spacey textures, creating full, lush sounds dominated a number of bands. 

#### THREE: Female Vocal Reverb.

This may be a production trend, or a choice of the bands themselves, it is difficult to be sure. The end product was that a lot of strong female voices (Wye Oak at the Mohawk, we are looking at you) tended to dominate inventive and compelling instrumentation. One longed for a decent dry, more immediate, vocal mix by the end of the week. 

#### FOUR: Fender Short scale Basses EVERYWHERE.

[Musicmasters](https://reverb.com/au/p/fender-musicmaster-bass-guitar) and [Mustangs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fender_Mustang_Bass), in both their reissue and occasionally original 70s form where noticeable. Generally used to play percussive 8th notes, MO was reminded to crack on with converting the cheap (eBay - Â£80) Squire Bronco sitting in the 'project pile' into a Mustang clone. A good top/mid heavy EQ profile and flat wound strings will provide the acme of SxSQ bass tone.

#### FIVE: The Hipster Moustache.

MO usually refrains from commenting on a bands appearance. BUt it is too difficult to resist an observation; a lot of young men where sporting top lip fluff of various levels of lusciousness. From the positively bristly 'scrubbing brush' to the wispy etherealness of _'my first moustache'_. 

### Very partial 'Highlights' list.
#### ONE: Random discovery - Emerson Star

One of lifes coincidences. A member of The President Lincoln was on a misson to see all the New Jersey bands at SxSW, or so it seemed. On this occasion we caught the excellent [Dentist](https://www.dentistband.com/info) who were so good, they caused us to order a second beer. At $6 a can, this meant we were present for the start of the very none New Jersey second act. Watching them set up, our party made uncharitable remarks about the presence of items one, two, four and several of item five on the 'trends' list. We did not want to like them, and planned on moving on. Thirty seconds into their set we had changed our minds. [Emerson Star](https://www.facebook.com/EmersonStar/), are from LA and play an urgent, driving set of songs with the sweetest of harmonies, causing several cynical old musicians to feel a joy and optimism about music they had not felt for a while. The band only has two tracks available at the time of writing, and neither really captures the full sound and joy of their live act. We are waiting with some anticipation for an album that does just that.

#### TWO: Canshaker Pi

We had been tipped off, via Rick at Nine Mile Records that this Dutch quartet were worth our time. The two shows we saw both had a few technial issues, but this did not distract from intense and focused performances. They mix bright arpeggios with frantic noise terror guitar and effects driven mayhem - hell of an experience and the two loudest shows of the week. As if to confirm trend number four, the bass player managed to close the deal on a red (refinished?) 1979 Musicmaster bass in the 14 hours between the two gigs. Sounded imense.

BONUS: If you live the in London, see them with MO on [11 May at The Old Blue Last on Great Eastern Street] (https://www.songkick.com/artists/8622099-canshaker-pi/calendar). MO will be the punter with the big grin and ear pugs.
 
#### THREE: The Ginger Man Bar
At [301 Lavaca Street](https://thegingerman.com/austin/), this dark, cool and welcoming bar with a grand range of draft beers also has an outdoor performance space out the back. MO enjoys a beer, and this felt like an archetypal US bar experience, with knowledgeable staff and super smooth service. 

#### FOUR: ABGB
Where to start... The pizza probably. Sent foraging for food to feed six hungry musicians the day of rehearsals, MO spotted that the warehouse across the road was advertising 'food'. It was the [Austin Beer Garden](https://theabgb.com/) and the pizza was immense, with whole roast garlic cloves and artichoke. The occasional benefits of hanging out with the vegans. Truely worth a diversion if you are ever in Texas.

The ABGB was also the venue of The President's last gig, on the Nine Mile Records St Patrick's day showcase. For the record, the best gig of the tour, as five days of playing together had tightened the band up and everyone was enjoying their last hurrah. Oh, and the beer? MO did his best to sample as many of the brews as possible, but we all know where that leads.

South by South West is a unique festival in an unusal city. If you get the opportunity, especially as a musician or supporting musicians, take it.
