Auditioning to play with a new band is a stressful experience at the best of times. While   through preparation, skill, daring-do and a level of delusion are must haves, 101 things can conspire to prevent you from landing the gig. Here is MO's handy guide to those running an audition, from the perspective of your potential new band mate.

1. Agree a couple of songs to perform at the audition. Then stick to them. One of the more dispiriting experiences MO has had was with a band looking for a replacement bass player. When asked what to learn for the audition, MO was told "pick one of the songs on Soundlcoud"




. On the evening of the audition, when turned up knowing the right notes, even if I was not going to play them very well, the band decided they had not played it for a while and "lets try something more recent". Cue frantic two minute conversation, with the guitarist writing chords down and me trying to take note of where the stops might be. Suffice to say, I did not get the gig - or want it.

2. Having decided on a song or two, then agree the version you are going to audition with - ideally, offer an MP3 or YouTube link, so that everyone starts and stops in the right places. Having ripped into an uptempo garage song, MO is suddenly massively out of sync as I plough my way through the original album version, while the band is playing a version off a bootleg. Just as a fall back in synchronisation, there is an unexpected space where the live version of the track has a 16 bar bass solo. Next!

3. As the auditioning band, provide some background on the proficiency and levels of experience of the other players, and the influences and intentions of the band. If you are auditioning musicians, you should have a view on whether you are more Iggy Pop than 

  The 'casual jam band' who were looking for someone 'not too serious' turned out to three jazz musicians with the most wonderful chops. Next!

4. If the audition space is anywhere other than on a main thoroughfare, provide detailed instruction on how to get there and a phone number, in case you need to check directions. This is a particular problem when the instructions are written by someone unfamiliar with the area. MO went to an audition 

5. After wards, be polite and let the auditioning parties know the outcome. It seems rude not to tell someone who had put a couple of hours work in and turned up to play with you, thanks, but no thanks.
